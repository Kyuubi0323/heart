A small gift. Heart shape PCB with STM32L0 microcontroller, TCA6416A I2C GPIO expander, LIS3DH accelerometer, BS812A touch sensor and some fancy leds.
 
It can be used as a keychain. It is operates on a CR2450 coin cell battery. There is a few led patterns which can be start by press a touch button or shake. When the device does not recognize any event in 10 seconds it will enter the low power mode and can be woke up only by touching button. In this mode the power consumption is about 25 uA.
