Small heart shape PCB with led diodes, that is battery powered and may be recharge with an USB cable. 

1. RP2040 microcontroller.
2. CR2032 battery, rechargable with an USB cable.
3. Small PCB dimensions (something around 60x60cm), with a possible to use as a keychain.
4. One small button to change modes, and one power switch.
5. Protect from short circuit (fuse or something like this).
6. WS2815 leds.
7. Battery voltage sense.
8. If not doing rechargable, protect from connect battery and vbus power supply at the same time. (Check TPS2113A ICs)
